The good old hand game with a tech twist. 
Here’s Rock, Paper & Scissor with ML. 

The rules are exactly as you are aware, the first one to get 3 points … Wins!

Play against your own machine with the help of Machine Learning in real-time palm and finger detection with Mediapipe Handpose Tensorflow package. MediaPipe Handpose is a lightweight ML pipeline consisting of two models: A palm detector and a hand-skeleton finger tracking model. It predicts 21 3D hand keypoints per detected hand. Ps - The computer's output is totally random, trust us.😒

Find out who’s better … YOU or your MACHINE? 😜😏
